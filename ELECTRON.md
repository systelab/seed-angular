# Going native with Electron

In order to create a native desktop app, you will need [electron.js][electron]. Electron is a framework that will allow you build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

> Specially important is the [autoUpdater API](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater) that enable apps to automatically update themselves.

To install Electron you have to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install electron -g
```

Once you have installed Electron, you have to create a new file in the project root folder named main.js

The content of the file should be something similar to this:

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');
const url = require('url');

let win;

function createWindow() {
	win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });

	// load the dist folder from Angular
	win.loadURL(
		url.format({
			pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'dist/index.html'),
			protocol: 'file:',
			slashes: true
		})
	);

	// Open the DevTools optionally:
	// win.webContents.openDevTools()

	win.on('closed', () => {
		win = null;
	});
}

app.on('ready', createWindow);

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
	if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
		app.quit();
	}
});

app.on('activate', () => {
	if (win === null) {
		createWindow();
	}
});
```

Also, you must add the following lines in the package.json file:

```json
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "electron": "ng build && electron .",
    "electron-aot": "ng build --prod && electron .",
    "electron-mac-generator": "electron-packager . --platform=darwin --electron-version=1.6.2"
  },
```

Finally, update your index.html file to let Electron find your files (change the base href) and add the required dependencies:

```html
<base href="./" />
<script>
	window.pako = require('pako');
	window.jQuery = require('jquery');
	window.Popper = require('popper.js');
	require('bootstrap');
</script>
```

Once this has been doing, run the following command to run and test the application:

```bash
npm run electron
```

## Generate native files

Electron Packager generates executables/bundles for the following target platforms:

-   Windows (also known as win32, for both 32/64 bit)
-   OS X (also known as darwin) / Mac App Store (also known as mas)
-   Linux (for x86, x86_64, armv7l, and arm64 architectures)

In order to install electron-packager you have to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install electron-packager -g
```

Run the following command to generate the native OS X application files.

```bash
npm run electron-mac-generator
```

Check the [Electron Packager documentation](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) for detailed information on how to generate for the different platforms.
